    term: "Element of Life",
    definition: "One of the six primary elements (CHONPS: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur) that make up 96% of living matter. These elements are essential because they form the backbone of biological molecules; for example, carbon's four valence electrons allow it to create diverse covalent bonds, enabling the complexity of organic compounds like proteins and DNA. Without these elements, life as we know it could not form stable structures or carry out reactions."
