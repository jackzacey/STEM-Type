{
  "course": "ap-biology",
  "unit": "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life",
  "term": "Lipid",
  "definition": "Lipids are hydrophobic organic molecules that do not dissolve in water. Fats store long-term energy, phospholipids form cell membranes, and steroids act as signaling molecules. Cells synthesize lipids from glycerol and fatty acids. These molecules provide insulation and cushion organs."
},
{
  "course": "ap-biology",
  "unit": "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life",
  "term": "Saturated Fatty Acid",
  "definition": "A saturated fatty acid contains only single bonds between carbon atoms and the maximum number of hydrogens. These straight chains pack tightly, making butter and animal fats solid at room temperature. High consumption can raise cholesterol levels. Plants rarely produce saturated fatty acids."
},
{
  "course": "ap-biology",
  "unit": "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life",
  "term": "Unsaturated Fatty Acid",
  "definition": "An unsaturated fatty acid has one or more double bonds between carbon atoms. The kinks prevent tight packing, so oils remain liquid at room temperature. Olive oil and fish oils contain many unsaturated fatty acids. These fats generally support heart health better than saturated fats."
},
{
  "course": "ap-biology",
  "unit": "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life",
  "term": "Phospholipid",
  "definition": "A phospholipid consists of a glycerol, two fatty acids, and a phosphate group. The phosphate head loves water, while the fatty acid tails repel water. Phospholipids spontaneously form bilayers that create cell membranes. This structure separates the cell from its environment."
},
{
  "course": "ap-biology",
  "unit": "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life",
  "term": "Protein",
  "definition": "Proteins are polymers of amino acids that perform most cellular work. Enzymes speed reactions, structural proteins provide support, and hormones carry signals. Each protein folds into a unique three-dimensional shape that determines function. Cells denature proteins with heat or pH changes."
},
{
  "course": "ap-biology",
  "unit": "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life",
  "term": "Amino Acid",
  "definition": "An amino acid contains a central carbon bonded to an amino group, carboxyl group, hydrogen, and a variable R group. Twenty different amino acids build all proteins in living organisms. The R group determines each amino acid's chemical properties. Cells link amino acids by peptide bonds."
},
{
  "course": "ap-biology",
  "unit": "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life",
  "term": "Peptide Bond",
  "definition": "A peptide bond is a covalent bond that links the carboxyl group of one amino acid to the amino group of another. Dehydration synthesis forms each peptide bond during protein construction. Enzymes called proteases break peptide bonds during digestion. Long chains of peptide bonds create polypeptides."
},
{
  "course": "ap-biology",
  "unit": "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life",
  "term": "Primary Structure",
  "definition": "Primary structure is the unique linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain. Peptide bonds hold the amino acids together in this exact order. Even one wrong amino acid can destroy protein function, as in sickle-cell disease. The primary structure determines all higher levels of folding."
},
{
  "course": "ap-biology",
  "unit": "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life",
  "term": "Denaturation",
  "definition": "Denaturation occurs when a protein loses its three-dimensional shape and function due to broken weak bonds. High temperature, extreme pH, or chemicals cause denaturation in cells and cooking. Most denatured proteins cannot refold correctly. Enzymes denature and stop working above certain temperatures."
},
{
  "course": "ap-biology",
  "unit": "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life",
  "term": "Nucleic Acid",
  "definition": "Nucleic acids are polymers that store and transmit genetic information in cells. DNA holds hereditary instructions, while RNA helps build proteins. Nucleotides containing a sugar, phosphate, and nitrogenous base form these long chains. Cells replicate DNA before division to pass genes to offspring."
},
{
  "course": "ap-biology",
  "unit": "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life",
  "term": "Nucleotide",
  "definition": "A nucleotide consists of a five-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. DNA and RNA are built from chains of nucleotides linked by phosphodiester bonds. ATP is a nucleotide that carries energy for cellular work. Cells constantly recycle and rebuild nucleotides."

{
  "course": "ap-biology",
  "unit": "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life",
  "term": "Cohesion",
  "definition": "Cohesion is the attraction between molecules of the same substance, such as water sticking to water. Hydrogen bonds between water molecules create high cohesion in liquid water. This property allows water to form droplets and move upward in plants. Cohesion supports tall trees through xylem vessels."
},
{
  "course": "ap-biology",
  "unit": "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life",
  "term": "Adhesion",
  "definition": "Adhesion is the attraction between molecules of different substances, such as water sticking to glass. Water adheres to cell walls in plants, counteracting gravity during transport. This property works with cohesion to move water upward in tall trees. Capillary action depends on adhesion."
},
{
  "course": "ap-biology",
  "unit": "Unit 1: Chemistry of Life",
  "term": "Specific Heat",
  "definition": "Specific heat is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of a substance by one degree Celsius.
